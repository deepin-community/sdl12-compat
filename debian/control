Description: SDL 1.2 binary compatibility library - transitional package
 sdl12-compat provides a binary compatible API for programs built
 against SDL 1.2, but using SDL 2.0.
 .
 If you are writing new code, please target SDL 2.0 directly instead
 of using this layer.
 .
 This transitional package provides symbolic links to the library in a private
 location, matching the way it was used before it was Debian's default
 implementation of the SDL 1.2 ABI.

Description: SDL 1.2 binary compatibility library wrapping SDL 2.0
 This package contains sdl12-compat, a binary compatible API for programs built
 against SDL 1.2, but using SDL 2.0.
 .
 This package replaces the classic SDL 1.2 library with the SDL 2.0
 compatibility layer, so that all SDL 1.2 program will use it.
 .
 If you are writing new code, please target SDL 2.0 directly instead
 of using this layer.
